Legend for Supplementary Data for "Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome" by Camilo Ruiz, Marinka Zitnik, and Jure Leskovec.

The supplementary data is described briefly below. Please refer to the methods for further details.

-- Components of Multiscale Interactome -- 
1. Supplementary dataset of interactions between drugs and proteins ("1_drug_to_protein.tsv")
2. Supplementary dataset of interactions between diseases and proteins ("2_indication_to_protein.tsv")
3. Supplementary dataset of interactions between proteins and proteins ("3_protein_to_protein.tsv")
4. Supplementary dataset of interactions between proteins and biological functions ("4_protein_to_biological_function.tsv")
5. Supplementary dataset of hierarchy of interactions between biological functions ("5_biological_function_to_biological_function.tsv")

The above five files all have the same column structure: node_1, node_2, node_1_type, node_2_type, node_1_name, and node_2_name. Entries in node_1 and node_2 correspond to IDs for the given node: DrugBank IDs are used for drugs, Entrez IDs are used for proteins, UMLS CUI IDs are used for indications, GO IDs are used for biological functions. Columns referring to node types denote the type of node (drug, protein, indication, biological_function).

-- Additional datasets --
6. Supplementary dataset of approved drug-disease pairs ("6_drug_indication_df.tsv")
Approved drug-disease treatment pairs. IDs correspond to DrugBank IDs for drugs and UMLS CUI IDs for indications. 

7. Supplementary dataset of drug classes according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification ("7_drug_classification_df.tsv")
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification of drugs used in this study. Columns include db_id (the DrugBank ID for the drug), atc_code (the full ATC code for the drug), and then multiple levels of the ATC code mapped by the code corresponding to that level and the corresponding name.

8. Supplementary dataset of selected gene expression signatures from the Broad Connectivity Map ("8_bcm_df.tsv")
The first six columns describe metadata for the gene expression signature: the drug column describes the DrugBank ID of the drug, the drug_name column is the drug's name, the sig_id column is the signature ID assigned by the Broad Connectivity Map, and the cell, dose, and time columns describe the conditions under which the signature was generated by the Broad Connectivity Map. The remaining columns are Entrez IDs for genes and the corresponding L5 signatures measured and computed by the Broad Connectivity Map.

9. Supplementary dataset of genetic mutations that alter drug response from PharmGKB ("9_pharmgkb_df.tsv")
Dataset from PharmGKB of genes that can alter treatment. DrugBank IDs are used for drugs, UMLS CUI IDs are used for diseases, Entrez IDs are used for genes. Clinical Annotation IDs are IDs provided by PharmGKB for the corresponding treatment alteration.

10. Supplementary dataset of optimized diffusion profiles ("10_top_msi/")
This folder contains the optimized diffusion profiles used in the main paper. Each file is a numpy (".npy") array. The beginning of the file name corresponds to either the DrugBank ID or name for the corresponding drug or the UMLS CUI ID or name for the corresponding disease. Each entry in the numpy array corresponds to the visitation frequency of a given node in the corresponding diffusion profile. To map each index of the numpy array to the corresponding node or vice-versa, the files "idx2node.pkl" and "node2idx.pkl" can be used. Finally, a reference graph "di_protein_go_graph.pkl" is provided here. This graph is principally provided to verify the accurate construction of the multiscale interactome from the manuscript.
